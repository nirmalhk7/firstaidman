<h3> Breathing Problems</h3>
<ol>
For victim who has stopped breathing:
<ol>
<li>Lay victim flat on back. Tilt the head back with one hand to open airway, while placing two fingers of
the other hand under the chin.
<li>Clear airway, using your fingers in a hooked fashion to remove any solid or liquid obstructions.
<li>Look, listen, and feel for respiratory movement for 5 seconds. If breathing is absent, pinch victim’s
nostrils closed, take a deep breath, completely cover victim’s mouth, and give two slow, full breaths.
<li>Check for carotid pulse in neck and for signs of breathing.
<li>If pulse is present:
<br><a href="#pulsepresentadult">For adults –</a> continue rescue breathing at a rate of one strong every five seconds.
Re-check for pulse and breathing every twelve breaths.
<br><a href="#pulsepresentinfantchildren">For infants and small children –</a> breathe shallow breaths at a rate of one every
three seconds or 20 per minute.
<li>If pulse is not present, begin Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).
