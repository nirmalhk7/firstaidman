<li><b>If bleeding is controlled by direct pressure</b>, bandage firmly to protect wound. Check pulse to be sure bandage is not too tight.
<li><b>If bleeding is not controlled by use of direct pressure</b>, apply a tourniquet only as a last resort.
<li>Call for professional medical help immediately.
<li><b>If you are bleeding and have no one to help you</b>, call for professional medical help.
</ol>
Lie down, so your body weight applies pressure to the bleeding site.
