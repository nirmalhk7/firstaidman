<li>If eye has been burned:
<ul>
<li>Immediately flood face, inside of eyelid and eye with cool running water for at least 15 minutes. Turn head so water does not drain into uninjured eye. Lift eyelid away from eye so the inside of lid can also be washed.
<li>If eye has been burned by a dry chemical, lift any loose particles off the eye with the corner of a sterile pad or clean cloth.
<li>Cover both eyes with dry sterile pads, clean cloths, or eye pads; bandage in place.
</ul>
<li>Consult professional medical help
