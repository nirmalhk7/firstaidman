thick dressings made from sterile pads or clean cloths secured in place with first aid tape, a belt or a
bandage.
<li> If object is protruding from victim, DO NOT move it. Immobilize object with thick dressings made from sterile pads or clean cloths secured in place with first aid tape, a belt or a bandage. Do not apply bandage so tightly that breathing is restricted.
</ul>
<li> If object penetrates chest and victim complains of discomfort or pressure, quickly loosen bandage on one side and reseal. Watch carefully for recurrence. Repeat procedure if necessary.
<li>If breathing problems develop, begin rescue breathing techniques immediately
</ol>
<p>
Follow this treatment for shock if necessary.
